My name is Adnane Miliari, I'm a Software Engineer from Morocco, I participated in the implementation of several development projects based on Java / JEE Technologies, and web services architecture. I have a mastery of Spring framework mainly Spring Boot, and am enthusiastic about everything related to DevOps culture and technologies, also AI.

I'm very dedicated to learn new things and to truly belive that you should never stop learning. I enjoy creating different things, whether that be websites, application or anything in between.

When I am not coding you can find me playing football, having fun with friends or pick up new skills.

I'm also a Speciality Tea drinking geek üçµ.
